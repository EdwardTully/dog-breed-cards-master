This is a react framework that I put together which will take an object of images and text and map each object as a card within div container. This project was exciting to me since it greatly simplifies an approach I did in the past building a webpage for a nascar collection. This project uses map(), a store, and useState.  It is fleshed out with an array of objects, which could represent json data.  There is a bug with the favorite dog state or something like that, that i cant figure out, and i need to move on.
